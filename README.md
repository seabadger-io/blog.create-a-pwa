#Implementing a Service Worker

##About
This repository is used to illustrate how to implement a Single Page Application (SPA)
which keeps working after the device goes offline. To achieve this I show how to 
register a ServiceWorker and implement basic caching using the Cache API.

##Quick Start
Just clone this repository and serve this page using a web server.
To see the base application without the ServiceWorker implementation,
clone this repository and check out the sw-start tag.
